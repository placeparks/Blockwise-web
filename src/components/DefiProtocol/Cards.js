                <p className="card-text">The traditional business model has been disrupted by the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi). This paradigm shift is revolutionizing the financial sector by eliminating the need for intermediaries, reducing costs, and enhancing transparency. DeFi's borderless nature enables people worldwide to access financial services and invest in previously inaccessible markets. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to grow, it presents a unique opportunity for businesses to adopt new models and technologies, transforming the way we interact with finance.</p></div>
